					 its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. 
					 The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum)
					  to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum).</p>

				<h3>Mapungubwe</h3>
					<p>Mapungubwe - "place of the stone of wisdom" - was South Africa's first kingdom, and developed into the subcontinent's largest realm, lasting for
						400 years before it was abandoned in the 14th century. Its highly sophisticated people traded gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt.
						
						The site lies on the open savannah of the See also Mapungubwe National Park, at the confluence of the Limpopo and Shashe Rivers.
						
						It abuts the northern border of South Africa and the borders of Zimbabwe and Botswana, a crossroads location that helps explain its prosperous
						past as an important trading centre, particularly at the height of its powers between about 1220 and 1300 AD.</p>
